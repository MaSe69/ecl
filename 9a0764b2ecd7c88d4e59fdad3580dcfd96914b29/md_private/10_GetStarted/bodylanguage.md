# Body Language - Fundamentals

Let's start with body language topics relevant for leaders in this and the subsequent chapters.

The first feature you observe on a new encounter is or her body language.
Body language typically relates to leadership rank. As an aspiring leader you might want to improve on your body language.

First, we look at some fundamentals. 
In later articles, submissive and dominant behavior is described. Smiling is so important that it deserves an own article. 
Finally, we focus on the role of body language for leaders.

Hence, the order is
- Fundamentals 
- Submissive
- Dominant
- Smile + Laughter
- Leader

Let us start here with some fundamentals of body language. 
Most of the below has been already well described elsewhere, but we need a basis to build upon.

Let's start with some basic feelings.


## Fundamental structure

Assumingly, you are familiar with the main brain regions and their main features.
Hence, you know that reactions triggered by the limbic system can hardly be suppressed and usually go unnoticed by both the individual and the observer.
The point here is to be aware about such signs in real life situations, to spot them and to react to them.

- Comfort, Discomfort
- Dislikes + Pacifiers
- Dominance and Submission
- Freeze, Flight, Fight


### Comfortable, Uncomfortable

At an point in time, you are either comfortable or uncomfortable. 
The tells of this state are subtle and thus not easy to spot. 
Due to the mirroring neurons and other mechanisms the state however is contagious. If everybody around us is uncomfortable, we tend to fell uncomfortable, too. 

This might trigger us to search for the reason and the indications. 
If somebody feels uncomfortable, 
- the body is more tense
- gestures are tighter
- eye contact breaks down quickly
- the tone sounds irritated

Often somebody feels uncomfortable just because not being dressed well for the temperature. Feeling overheated or freezing makes us uncomfortable over time.
Regularly, ask yourself
- Are you comfortable?
- If not, what is the reason?
- If the reason is detected, can something be done about it?

Aim to be comfortable as much as possible and help others to become comfortable again, if they show signs of having become uncomfortable.

### Dislikes + Pacifiers

- cover your eyes
"blind children cover their eyes when they HEAR something they don't like."
- wrinkle your nose
- touch your head, neck, fingers
- rub, stroke
- self-hug
- smoke or chew quicker
- play with something


### Dominance and Submission


Competitive situations are very common. Individuals in such competitive situations show either dominant or submissive behavior. Which one is chosen depends on the importance given to the situation and the other persons. 

<blockquote>
    The unvarnished truth is that almost all the people you meet <br> 
    feel themselves superior to you in some way.
<span>Dale Carnegie</span>
</blockquote>

In important situations with rivals around you, you go for a dominant body language. This includes
- dressing yourself expensively
- making yourself taller
- making space-filling gestures
- caring about a loud voice

In situations you rather want to get out off, you 
- dress yourself inconspicuously
- make yourself invisible
- hardly move
- speak with a timid voice

Be aware of situations in which you are expected to be dominant and choose then dominant body language whilst avoiding submissive body language.


### Freeze, Flight, Fight

Dangerous situations are lucky rare. Usually, before we become aware that danger is around, our unconscious parts of the brain are triggered.
These parts trigger a reaction which makes anybody at first to freeze, then to flee and finally to fight.
Though we do not run away from tigers nowadays, the body reactions are still visible as a reaction to a new situation.
During the freeze, the individual assesses the unconsciously perceived thread. He stops, hesitates, makes mistakes on whatever he is doing.

Watch out for such freezing reactions.
If you get aware of a freezing reaction, figure out what has caused it. A thread perceived by somebody else might be a thread to you as well. 

<blockquote>
    Consider being on a date, when your new friend freezes. You figure out that her ex-boyfriend entered the restaurant. 
<span>Example</span>
</blockquote>

The freezing reaction can evaporate into normality quickly, when the situation is assessed to be harmless. Often, we make mistakes because a trigger once real might be active during a lifetime.
In the other case, the individual starts on a flight. In practice, your partner might tell you that he or she wants to leave quickly. 
Fight reactions nowadays are usually shown by aggressive gestures or a tone typical for anger or sarcasm.


# Summary and Outlook

In this section, we started with some basic feelings that you should look out for in body language.
In a dialog, you should notice tells of
- being uncomfortable
- trying to be dominant or submissive
- freezing, possibly followed by flight or fight actions
