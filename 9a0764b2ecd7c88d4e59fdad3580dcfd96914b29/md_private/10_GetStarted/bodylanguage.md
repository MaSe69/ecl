This is a topic that you really cannot afford to miss.
You find here all that you need to know about writing a good article.
It catches the eye of the reader and the reader wants to scan through it.

- Use good sentences
- Add some spice (quotes, images) here and there

</blockquote>

### Third sub-point of the first main point
