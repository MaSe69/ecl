# Leadership

There are two types of leadership
- the hierarchical leadership
- the equality leadership

Neither of them, in their pure and radical form I would suggest to be appropriate in the 21st century.
Rather, there is need to understand both types of leadership and to apply the respective skills.
This I would call here
- the bi-polar leadership

Let's start with the hierarchical leadership, because this is what most of us have in mind when thinking about a leader.

## Hierarchical Leadership 

A hierarchy is defined by so-called positions which enable the individual that is in this position to influence the lives of their sub-ordinates. This influence usually affects time, possessions - and at times, it is about live and death.

### Classical

In classical leadership theory, there is a well-defined ladder of positions. 
Often, decimals are used, with 
- the first position leading 10 individuals, squad leads
- the second position leading 10 squad leads, i.e. 100 individuals, i.e. centurions.
- the third position leading 10 centurions - and so on.

The top position is well-defined, and given a dedicated name:
- commander-in-chief
- maximum leader    

and enriched with plentiful and attractive signs of power.

### Sun Tzu

One of the oldest, known leaders is Sun Tzu who lived at about 2500 ago in China.
Reportedly, Sun Tzu got into power particularly because he did not hesitate to order the beheading of two concubines who did not follow his orders.
> "'If words of command are not clear and distinct, if orders are not thoroughly understood, then the general is to blame. But if his orders are clear, and the soldiers disobey, then it is the fault of their officers.'
So [Sun Tzu] ordered the leaders of the two companies to be beheaded." (The art of war)

Apart from his undisputable power, a classical leader has features like
- a strong urge for perfection
