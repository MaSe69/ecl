# Leadership

There are two types of leadership
- the hierarchical leadership
- the equality leadership

Neither of them, in their pure and radical form I would suggest to be appropriate in the 21st century.
Rather, there is need to understand both types of leadership and to apply the respective skills.
This I would call here
- the bi-polar leadership

Let's start with the hierarchical leadership, because this is what most of us have in mind when thinking about a leader.
