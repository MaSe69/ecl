# "Principles: Life and Work" vs. "The Seven Day Weekend"

In this blog, I am going to compare some key messages of the book  ["Principles: Life and Work"](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021/) by [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) with the respective ones of ["The Seven-Day-Weekend"](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Day-Weekend-Better-Work-Century/dp/0099425238/) by [Ricardo Semler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Semler).

Both books are massive in their content reflecting the considerable achievements of their authors and their companies ['Bridgewaters'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates) and 'Semco'. 
Both books score high on their Amazon rating (~4.6 out of 5) and get overwhelmingly high praise. However, in the comments on Amazon also some doubts were raised. 'Principles' might fall short of actionable advice and contain a lot of truisms.
In fact, half way through 'Principles' I wondered: "Haven't I read the same content already a few times?"

Hence, I came up with the idea to search for the top 3 similarities and top 3 differences between the last book of my favorite author and Dalio's book.
To cut it short, here are the respective ones.

The top 3 similarities:

- Strong visions
- Setting Goals
- Measuring Outcomes

The Top 3 differences:

- Foundation
- Hiring
- Choosing New Goals

# Top 3 Similarities

Assumingly, I can keep the similarities short because when you read this kind of blog you have read a lot of books that already described these similarities. However, when reading such books, it is worth to be on the lookout when these topics come up and if the author can add improvements to their descriptions or valuable own experience.

## 1 - Strong visions

An entrepreneur typically has a clear picture of what he wants to achieved and he takes decisive actions.

For Semler, democracy at the work place has been key. People make decisions about their time and goals outside their workplace, hence, they should do the same at their workplace.

>
I wanted to [create] an entirely new kind of organization [by] instituting true democracy at Semco. <br>
Within day of taking over, I fired outright two-thirds of my father's most senior managers.
Weekend, p. 9

For Dalio, doing something that is fun to do and keeps you in touch with people of your choice has been important.
>
I wanted meaningful work and meaningful relationships equally, and I valued money less - as long as I had enough to take care of my basic needs.
Principles. p. 23

For both, technolog and innovations are of high importance.

## 2 - Setting Goals

An entrepreneur needs a thorough understanding of the general business and its niches.

>
All our business units are highly engineered, premium providers and market leaders to their niches. We haven't ventured into any of them by chance.
<br>Weekend. p. 12

Within a chosen business niche, an entrepreneur optimizes by setting big goals.
>
“Stretching for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions in order to move forward.”
<br>Principles - p.136ff

For both, being ambitious and successful at reaching goals is of importance.


## 3 - Measuring Outcomes

An entrepreneur wants to know exactly where the company stands wrt the targets.

Sure there is a commitment an employee has to make and to wholeheartedly fulfill. If you fulfilled that commitment though, then "go to the beach", your over-commitment might cause more harm then good.

>
Ideally, someone other than you should be objectively measuring and reporting on your progress.
<br>Principles - p.175ff

For both, the company seems always to be too far away from the goals and they spend a lot of time thinking about actions on how to get closer.

# Top 3 Differences

Considerably more interesting are the differences. 


## Foundation

For Semler, democracy is a the foundation. In a democracy, there are different cultures, tribes, points of views. Actions first need a democratic consent, which is sometimes difficult to get to.

>
It's easy to talk about respecting diversity, tribal characteristics and dissent. But when action is required, anyone who has tried to lead in a democratic manner knows how frustrating, slow and cumbersome it is. <br>
That is why business leaders [prefer] command and execute methods, [but those methods do not] lead to the productivity gains that occur when people find it worthwhile to get up in the morning for work.
<br>Weekend, p. 171

For Dalio, in contrast, a 'machine, i.e. a worked out design of a business model is the foundation. 

>
You have your goals. I call the way you will operate to achieve your goals your machine. It consists of a design (the things that have to get done) and the people (who will do the things that need getting done).
Principles, p. 157



## Hiring

For Semler, the democratic approach leads to a hiring of very diverse persons.
>
A sustainable company will put a 57-year-old GM alumni in an office with a dot.com kid.
<br>Weekend, p. 166

>
We called [the 18-year old student and hacker] Rafael and offered him the opportunity to come work for us. What he would do, how much he'd make, all that would come later.
<br>Weekend p. 168

Further, it leaves the goal setting to these persons.

For Dalio, the vision approach leads to an optimized filtering for fitting experts.

>
When building "a machine", design precedes people because the type of people you will need will depend on the design. <br>
In oder to match a person to the design, start by creating a spec sheet so that there will be a consistent set of criteria that can be applied from recruiting through performance reviews.
Principles, p. 407

Once this machine is perfected in the mind of the entrepreneur, he adds (believable) people to the machine where needed.
>
I define believable people as those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question – who have a strong track record with at least three successes – and have great explanations of their approach when probed. 
<br>Principles - p.190

Every employee shall fulfill exactly the role assigned to in the context of that machine. If the machine works perfectly in reality, the result is of extraordinary quality. It beats anything of the competitor's offerings and enables considerable profit.

## Choosing New Goals

For Semler, continuous search for innovation is key. Intuition is of high value in this context. New ideas shall be evaluated based on the intuition of a diverse group.

>
We gather once a month to hear new ideas. <br>
Anybody can show up and participate [in a Go/No Go meeting]. There's a discussion, and at the end of the meeting, a vote - go or no go.
Weekend - p. 242

For Dalio, after the idea is present in the mind of the entrepreneur the focus of the company is on its optimization in the real world.
>
“The real-world issues of cost, time and personnel will undoubtedly surface [...] and this will lead you to refine your design until all the gears in the machine are meshing smoothly.
<br>Principles - p.175ff


# Discussion 

Both authors managed to build up or grow successful companies while disagreeing on essential points.
What does this mean for the importance of similarities and differences?

It is plausible that Dalio found fun and fulfillment in his career. I wonder how much fun it might be to be a human part of his 'machine'.
Doubts might be that this approach - outside a small leadership circle - leads to a confinement to a job description that stiffles creativity.

For fairness, I don't know of hard facts that address such doubts towards the Semco-style approach. How much of these employees in the various units are really working in full-scale democracy?
How many ideas from bottom-up have really been converted into products?

# Conclusion

Both books have been well worth my time and I can recommend reading both of them. I feel to have benefitted from many pieces of non-trivial advice.

'Principles' is much more structured and when your task is to detail out what's called here 'similarities' I would recommend particularly the first part of it.
Working in the field of data science, I am inclined towards Dalio's data-driven optimization approach. It appeals to me to be in a chosen niche the best of the best and to optimize for that based on data.

'Weekend' focuses on the effects of democracy at the workplace. Time management, hiring and goal setting are main topics.

It appears plausible that in the short term Dalio's approach leads to more success and hence more profit for the company. Such profitability in turn lead to the 'problems' that Semler pointed out.
In the long term, it appears more likely that the 'Semco-Style' approach proves to be more robust.
