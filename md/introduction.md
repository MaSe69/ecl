# Introduction

The vision here is: 
**Everybody should become a better leader!**

Why should we have many, good leaders?
Leaders transform society. Society needs many and various leaders. 
Books and movies are full of stories describing a follower turning into a leader.

Leadership is independent of hierachical positions. 
Many people search to improve their leadership skills when they aim for a management position or just got into one. That's ok. You are most welcome here, if you do so. However, no matter how inexperienced you are or how many successes are behind you, there is still so much to improve on.


## "How to become a leader?"

A constructive leadership introduction should you to increase your leadership skills and knowledge.

The approach taken here is that leadership is comparable to a decatholon. 
There are various disciplines. It is better to be above a minimum level in all these disciplines than just to excel in one of them. 

Some categorizations of leadership in such disciplines have already been done. The wheel does not have to be re-invented here. On top of a chassis, however, cars have been adapted to suit their environment and their owner's requirements. Sticking with this picture, digitalization has entered cars and similarly, digitalization enters leadership. 

Leadership has drastically changed over time.
A leader in 2020 might be something different than in earlier days.
If you knew everything about leadership in the 15th century, you still have to make the transfer to today's world.


## Which are disciplines here?

Among the disciplines are
- the leader's environment
- personality
- envisioning
- psychology
- body language
and others.

As in a decatholon, the score of a leader is the sum of the points he gets in the various disciplines.

Let's assume a high score of 10 in each discipline and there is somebody how scores one point in each discipline. 
Reaching 10 out of 100 points, on a leadership scale that also ranges from 0 to 10, he achieves one out of 10 points. He is on level one, so to say.

Being on leadership level 1 with some knowledge and skills in every area is not a bad start. Many aspirants to leadership focus on a single discipline. Very popular are the topics personality, communications or project management.

But
- How much use is here a deep personality, if nobody gets a clear picture of your goals?
- How helpful are communication skills, if your risk assessment of an adventure is situated in fairyland?
- How prone to failure is project management without the endurance to see it to the end?

You better run through the whole cycle of leadership skills again and again. Watch yourself and collect feedback on how you do in these disciplines. 


## Reward and Risk

Becoming a better leader, climbing up through the leadership levels, increases your influence and your popularity. People will notice. People will start to trust you. People will start to follow you.
You might be even asked for accepting a hierarchical position or to move up the hierarchical ladder.

With leadership comes reward. Your income increases, your status increases, your attractiveness increases. You receive higher levels on the 'happiness hormones': dopamine, oxytocin, endorphin, serotonin. Your life will be happier, your life will be more fulfilled. In tendency, you will live longer.

On the other side, as a leader you are expected to be the first to fight. If your followers are attacked for following your visions, you are the one expected to be the fiercest on the defence. Bad luck, if you underestimated the strength of your external enemies.

From the internal side, there are always would-be number ones who can't wait for you to make mistakes and who are eager to seize your resources. At first, there might be jokes. Then, followers might ignore your wishes. Finally, you might decide to leave, before worse things might happen.

Ideally, leadership skills match responsibility.


## Conclusion

This here is all about becoming a better leader by improving on specific disciplines.
For each discipline, guidelines will be provided leading to deeper understanding and better skills.
