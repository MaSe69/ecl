# Introduction

"How to become a leader?"
Most literature describe how a leader is. 
A constructive leadership introduction trains you to become a leader yourself.

"Why to become a leader?"
Some people take it as a given fact that everybody wants to become a leader. Others regard leaders as evil.
Become a leader takes quite some effort. Why bother, if you are not convinced?

"How has leadership changed over time?"
The same word can mean different things at different times.
A leader in 2020 might be something different than in earlier days.
If you knew everything about leadership in the 15th century, you still have to make the transfer to today's world.
