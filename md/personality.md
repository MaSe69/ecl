# Personality

Personality is the one part of leadership that has nothing to do with connecting or getting things done.
If somebody scores 10 out of 10 on personality, but is a zero on the other leadership skills, nobody would recognize him as a leader. On the other side, a personality requires a certain depth to enable leadership.

Personality might be like a round rock on the mountain. The heavier the rock and the higher up it is, the more impact that rock will have when rumbling down towards the valley. If the rock stays where it is, nobody might notice its potential. 
Unlike such a rock, a leader can increase its potential energy by increasing his personality.
