# Vision

Leadership is about transformation. A leader actively transforms a group from a state A to a state B. The new state is nothing that just would happen anyway, e.g. growing older. Neither is it something obvious, like doubling the revenues of a company.

The new state first manifests itself on the mind of the leader - as a vision. Some circumstances are beneficial for such a vision to be created.

- an imagination of the desireable
- an understanding of the group 
- an understanding of the real possibilities and likelihoods


## An imagination of the desireable

This is the part of creativity and phantasy.
Phantasy is about worlds that might of might not exist.
A plot of how people would behave in such a world.
An assessment on how much such a behavior would be better or worse than the real world behavior.

Many phantasy worlds have ben dreamt of and played through. Some creators of such phantasy worlds wrote books in which parts of their imagination survived. The format of a book has had many limitations, hence, only a part of the universe of pas and present phantasies is accessible. Nevertheless, literature has more tales of imaginary worlds than anybody nowadays has time to read.

Naturally, a leader tabs into the wealth of inspirations already out there.
Which ones to select?

Many narratives are essentially descriptive. You might get a good understanding how things have changed since then. You might also benefit from contemplating the difference between then and now and between now and the perceived future.
Many narratives have at their core a moral, some ethical point they want to convey. It takes some effort to get clear about the particular moral and to compare it with your own moral. 
Many narratives are entertaining. This is nice and relaxing, but does not help in the context of creating a vision.

A good narrative for envisioning
- is relevant to your situations
- reveals new insights
- embeds its points into a memorable story that you also like to remember.
