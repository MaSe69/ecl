# "Principles: Life and Work" vs. "The Seven Day Weekend"

In this blog, I am going to compare some key messages of the book  ["Principles: Life and Work"](https://www.amazon.com/Principles-Life-Work-Ray-Dalio/dp/1501124021/) by [Ray Dalio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ray_Dalio) with the respective ones of ["The Seven-Day-Weekend"](https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Day-Weekend-Better-Work-Century/dp/0099425238/) by [Ricardo Semler](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ricardo_Semler).

Both books are massive in their content reflecting the considerable achievements of their authors and their companies ['Bridgewaters'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bridgewater_Associates) and 'Semco'. Both books score high on their Amazon rating (~4.6 out of 5) and get overwhelmingly high praise. However, in the comments on Amazon also some doubts were raised. 'Principles' might fall short of actionable advice and contain a lot of truisms.
In fact, half way through 'Principles' I wondered: "Haven't I read the same content already a few times?"

Hence, I came up with the idea to search for the top 3 similarities and top 3 differences between principles and the best respective book that was so far on my reading list.
To cut it short, here are the respective ones.

The top 3 similarities:

- The need of an understanding on how to treat employees
- Developing own optimization targets
- Measurements wrt those goals and reacting to data

The Top 3 differences:

- Start from the product vs. start from the employees
- Hierarchy and compensation
- Succession management

# Top 3 Similarities

## 1 - Managing Employees

An entrepreneur spends a lot of time to get the right people into the respective positions in his company.
This includes the right skills and the right experience.

It also includes the right attitude towards the company and her goals. This includes the felt warmth by the business owner. Both can be trusted to go at great length to help their employees particularly when desaster strikes.

## 2 - Setting Ambitious Goals

An entrepreneur needs a thorough understanding of the business he is in. 

>
Be number one or number two. Overcome a threshold difficult for others. Deliver high-end, premium services.
<br>Weekend

Within this business he searches for niches within which he optimizes.
>
“Stretching for big goals puts me in the position of failing and needing to learn and come up with new inventions in order to move forward.”
<br>Principles - p.136ff


## 3 - Measuring Outcomes

An entrepreneur wants to know exactly where the company stands wrt the targets.

>
Ideally, someone other than you should be objectively measuring and reporting on your progress.
<br>Principles - p.175ff

The company seems always to be too far away and he spends a lot of time thinking about actions to get closer.

I can keep the similarities short because when you read this kind of blog you have read a lot of books that already described these similarities. As I continue reading such books, I am on the lookout when these topics come up and if the author can add nuances to them.

# Top 3 Differences

Considerably more interesting are the differences. If the authors managed to build up successful companies while disagreeing on essential points, doesn't this mean that these essential points are irrelevant to success? Perhaps, these essential points are of relevance to the happiness of their employees - but I can only give food for thought here.

## Start

Exaggerating Semler's point for clarity here: You could just hire the first 100 people you meet on any day on a crossing - and build a successful company with them. If you run a company with 100.000+ employees, that's what you are doing anyway: You end up with a cross section of what is available as workforce on the job market. In a democracy, that's also what you should do as an entrepreneur, because at the end of the day business is there for improving the life of the people in a democracy. Sure there is a commitment an employee has to make and to wholeheartedly fulfill. If you fulfilled that commitment though, then "go to the beach", your over-commitment might cause more harm then good.

Exaggerating Dalio's point for clarity here: The entrepreneur designs a business model, a 'machine'. All depends on the quality of that machine which needs to be continously optimized.

>
“The real-world issues of cost, time and personnel will undoubtedly surface [...] and this will lead you to refine your design until all the gears in the machine are meshing smoothly.
<br>Principles - p.175ff

Once this machine is perfected in the mind of the entrepreneur, he adds (believable) people to the machine where needed.

>
I define believable people as those who have repeatedly and successfully accomplished the thing in question – who have a strong track record with at least three successes – and have great explanations of their approach when probed. Principles - p.190

Every employee shall fulfill exactly the role assigned to in the context of that machine. If the machine works perfectly in reality, the result is of extraordinary quality. It beats anything of the competitor's offerings and enables considerable profit.

In short, Semler's starting point are the 'capable people in a democracy' whilst Dalio's staring point is a worked-out vision of the entrepreneur.

## Hierarchy and Compensation

As Semler starts on the principle of a democracy consisting of responsible citizens, there should be as little hierarchy as possible. If there is still the need for a boss, his or her performance shall be rated by the direct reports and this boss replaced on poor leadership.
The company needs a certain part of the profit to survive and invest into the future, but anything else shall be distributed to the employees. Transparency of the company's balance sheet to the employees is key to keep the trust of the employees into participating on the profit.
Reportedly, Semco's standard salaries are below respective industry average, particularly for top positions.

Dalio, in contrast, wants to hire "the best of the best of the best". Surely, this comes at having to offer top salaries to attract and keep those experts. For employees searching to maximize their income, Bridgewater should be on the short list.
Hierarchies have been established along the lines of 'the machine'. As the machine as more important and less important parts, so does the hierarchy on human resources.
It follows naturally that firing comes easy when failing on expectations.

## Succession management

This point might not deserve the quality of an independent section. However, as reader you will spend some time with it.
Semler proudly describes how the parts of his company run smoothly without him. While he can focus on wisdom, i.e. setting the big picture and guaranteeing financial stability, everything is taken care of without bothering him with inevitable day-to-day troubles.
Dalio on the other side describes how his first hand-over for his retirement failed and how much care he needed to take to make a promising second attempt. When, during Dalio's first absence quality suffered, he felt obliged to return and fire the respective management.

# My Conclusion

Both books have been well worth my time and I can recommend reading both of them. I feel to have benefitted from many pieces of non-trivial advice.

'Principles' is much more structured and when your task is to detail out what's called here 'similarities' I would recommend particularly the first part of it.
Working in the field of data science, I am inclined towards Dalio's data-driven optimization approach. It appeals to me to be in a chosen niche the best of the best and to optimize for that based on data.
However, doubts are that this approach bears the risks of potentially intimidating control that stiffles creativity outside a small leadership circle.

'Weekend' reflects the more laissez-faire approach. It is more difficult to get to down to core of it.

It appears plausible that in the short term Dalio's approach leads to more success and hence more profit for the company. Such profitability in turn lead to the 'problems' that Semler pointed out.
In the long term, it appears more likely that the 'Semco-Style' approach proves to be more robust.
